# HR Analytics Project

Welcome to my **first data analysis project**! This project focuses on exploring and analyzing HR data to uncover patterns related to employee satisfaction, performance, turnover, and more. 
It's designed to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and deriving actionable insights.

## Project Files

- **HR Analysis - start.xlsx**  
  Raw dataset containing employee-related information such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.

- **HR Analysis - final.xlsx**  
  Cleaned and analyzed version of the dataset with added visualizations, summary statistics, and final insights.

## ðŸ§  Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning & transformation using Excel
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Pivot tables & charts
- Creating dashboards and visual summaries
- Deriving insights to support HR decision-making

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Some of the interesting findings from the analysis include:
- Factors most correlated with employee attrition
- Job roles with the highest turnover
- Trends in satisfaction, workload, and compensation
- Visual summaries to help HR teams take proactive action

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Excel**: for data transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation
- (Future projects will include Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for now, will update as I go along)

## âœ… Whatâ€™s Next

This is the first of a series of projects I plan to publish on GitHub to showcase my journey in data analysis. Future projects will build on this and use tools such as Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and SQL for deeper and more automated analysis.

## ðŸ“¬ Feedback

I'm continuously learning â€” feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/vlado-cyber/hr-analysis/issues) or leave suggestions on how I can improve.
